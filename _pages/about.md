I am a climate scientist working on paleoclimate variability, hydroclimate extremes, ocean circulation, and climate data reconstruction. My research combines climate dynamics, statistical methods, reanalysis products, and numerical modeling to better understand variability across seasonal to centennial timescales.

My recent work has focused on global monthly sea surface temperature and sea ice reconstructions, paleo-reanalysis products, Atlantic jet stream variability, AMOC dynamics, and climate data tools for analysis and visualization.

I am particularly interested in:
- paleoclimate and hydroclimate variability
- Atlantic circulation and AMOC dynamics
- climate reanalysis and reconstruction
- climate data analysis in Python
- data products, tools, and reproducible workflows
